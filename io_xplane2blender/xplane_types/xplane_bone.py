"""
About the XPlaneBone/XPlaneObject API
=====================================
XPlane2Blender makes it's own hierarchy of Blender objects,
which under most circumstances looks nearly identical
to the Blender hierarchy in the outliner.

However, where as the Blender Outliner is focused on Collections and Objects and the parent-child
connections between them, the XPlane2Blender hierarchy is focused on a tree
structure of XPlaneBones with XPlaneObjects optionally associated with them.

XPlane2Blender primarily uses this tree to make animations

Rules:
- XPlaneBones are made for the Root Collection and every Object and Armature Bone encountered
- XPlaneBones will not have an XPlaneObject if the Blender Object is unconvertible (such as the root collection, camera, and sound emitters)
- Every XPlaneBone (except the Root Bone under collections) must have a Blender Object associated with it
- Every Blender Object appears in the XPlaneBone Tree exactly once

Special Collection Rules:
- The root bone will have no Blender Object or XPlaneObject associated with it

Because XPlaneBones represent different relationships than Blender's parent-child
relationships, it cannot be assumed that the XPlaneBone Tree and Blender Hierarchy are the same.

**Therefore, all APIs should use the XPlaneBone tree's version of parent and child lookups instead of the Blender's!**
